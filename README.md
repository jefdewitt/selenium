# Selenium Basics

## This is how we roll with Selenium for Java. This is my first non-enterprise project with Java so I'm just gonna learn as I go.

### Setup for Mac
<!-- First, look for Java on your machine -->
- In Terminal, run `$ java -version`
<!-- If this doesn't work then we'll have to install the JDK-->
- Run `$ brew install java` to get the latest version or...
- Google 'Java download for Mac'
<!-- Shortcut URL to search results link: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html-->
- You should install jEnv to handle multiple Java verions (similar to nvm for Node.js)s
- `$ brew install jenv`
- There's a bit of setup involved and after that's complete run `$ jenv global <java-version>` to switch versionss
- For a list of available Java versions on your machine, run `$ jenv versions`.
